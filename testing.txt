A note on test cases, found in the test_cases folder:

The name of each test case found in the directory follows the following format:

Failure cases: test_<failure>_<t>_<[single_client|multi_client]>.csv
or
Happy path: test_happy_path_<t>_<[single_client|multi_client]>.csv
or
Stress: test_stress.csv

Thus the test conditions are signified by the file name itself.
Additionally, there is one test case labelled test_stress.csv which is a stress test featuring 10 clients and
100 operations selected at random from our repository of random operations.

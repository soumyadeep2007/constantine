A note on test cases, found in the test_cases folder:
The name of each test case found in the directory follows the following format:

Failure cases: test_<failure>_<t>_<[single_client|multi_client]>.csv
or
Happy path: test_happy_path_<t>_<[single_client|multi_client]>.csv
or
Stress: test_stress.csv

Thus the test conditions are signified by the file name itself.

Additionally, there is one test case labelled test_stress.csv which is a stress test featuring 10 clients and
100 operations selected at random from our repository of random operations.

The name of the log file for each test case has the same name as the test case with a .log suffix.
